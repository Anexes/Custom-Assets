%player accidentally signed the wrong contract and created the group "%partyName" including %partyMembers.
%player can not remember where %hisher last party wandered off to, so %she forms "%partyName" with %partyMembers!
%player streaks through chat. %partyMembers like what they see. %partyName was formed as a result!
