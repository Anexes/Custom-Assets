%player's %item starts falling apart right after the warranty expires.
%player thought %heshe could fly. %Hisher %item paid the price
$random:player#1$ shoves $random:player#2$ but $random:player#2$'s weight causes $random:player#1$ to fall back on to %player's %item. $random:player#1$'s blood, having been cursed by $dict:deity$, causes %player's %item to tarnish and fall apart in %hisher hand.
